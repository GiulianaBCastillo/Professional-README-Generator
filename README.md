## Usage

I created this command-line application so that you can quickly and easily create a professional README file. This will allow the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

The app dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

The application is invoked by using the following command:

node index.js

  * When the user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
    * The title of my project 
    * Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing
